            Hello! I'm Kyrian, a software/devops engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.
          </p>
          <p>
            I
            am professionally connected with the web development industry and information technology
            for many years and have developed strong abilities in management and fostered a
            reputation as a key contributor through organization and leadership
            skills. As a team player, I am collaborative with peers and search
            for ways to integrate valuable insights. I have proven my ability to
            facilitate positive change and collective effort.
            My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect user interfaces by applying site reliablity engineering principles in the delivery of an IT project.

            >,  I joined the engineering team at Eazox as the team lead where we worked on a wide variety of interesting projects.
            Currently, I mentor aspiring developers in the Google Africa Developer Scholarship to become professionals with skills that can get them opportunities after the program.
